# Read and verify the response of the NodeJS servers
# This part depends on the structure of the playbook and the expected response
# You may need to parse the playbook output to extract relevant information
# and verify the response of the NodeJS servers accordingly
# For example:
if return_code == 0:
    print("Playbook executed successfully.")
    # Your verification code here
else:
    print("Playbook execution failed.")
